I like being in hot thermal baths ideally in nature. It's just not the same experience dipping in and out of hot saunas, thermal baths and ice-cold baths inside a downtown spa, indoors. Doing it outside somehow makes the experience feel more authentic, like the way the Finns, Norwegians and Swedes do it where they actually roll around in snowbanks as well.  \n\nI came to Str\u00f8m today for the first time. It's located on Nun's Island right beside the pond in the back part of the island and indeed you feel like you're out of the city and not a mere 15 minute bus ride away from downtown Montreal. I came in using the Bus (#12 from Verdun) and was here in 30 minutes flat. Even in the middle of winter, it's a beautiful location so I can only imagine how lovely it must be in the summertime. It's too bad there isn't a pedestrianized bridge between Verdun's riverside and Nun's island because if that were the case, I could probably walk over in 5 minutes flat.\n\nI've been to other outdoor Nordic spas, like Le Spa des Chutes de Bolton, which has a real river and waterfall for dipping into and I have to echo other posters sentiments here. While the location is great, the facilities are clean, the design in somewhat off. Normally when you do the water circuit, you start off with getting your body very hot in the sauna or thermal bath pools then a 5 second dip in freezing water to get the heart pumping and then you chill in the relaxation area so it's ideal to have these 3 spots located VERY close to each other, especially when you walk out of freezing water. Not so here, there is a bit of walk between spots.\n\nAlso, I think practically all of Montreal had the same idea as I did and showed up today. There was a waiting list to get in if you hadn't made reservations. Thankfully the wait wasn't too long but this is something they should definitely mention on their website. It was crowded, not uncomfortably so because a crowded spa defeats its purpose, doesn't it? When I come again, I'm definitely coming at a less busy time. Bring your flip flops and your bathrobe to save some $$. \nThe lockers were somewhat small and the changing rooms can get crowded especially with everyone's winter boots taking up space. But the showers were clean and the relaxation rooms are definitely a great place to unwind with a glass of wine or rose-petal latte afterwards. \nFood here is pretty good. I had the French onion soup and it hit the spot.\nOverall, the place is absolutely worth a visit.", "date": "2017-01-02 04:40:29"}

It is truly special to be in a spa like this outside in nature, enjoying the beauty of a Canadian frozen waterway while basking in the warm glow of a fireplace in one of their relaxation rooms or in the Finnish dry sauna. The eucalyptus steam room helped clear my nasal passages and I enjoyed trying their multiple thermal baths. It seems to be a hidden gem amongst the locals, as some people from the city of Montreal had commented to me that they are reluctant to make the trek to Nun's Island and hadn't heard of it. It actually took about 15 min to get there from Montreal downtown, so I highly recommend doing it. The wine and food selection at their cafe was surprisingly good. Their assorted cheeses come with a lovely little smattering of nuts, dried fruit, sprouts, and carmelized onions paired with water crackers and baguette slices. I recommend you pay it a visit for a post-spa drink and snack for a little extra indulgence while you're at it! I happened to stay long enough that day to see Cozy Thursday happen which happens the first first of every month- after 6:30pm, the cafe has wine & food pairings for a special set price and a live dj.

We had a massage each and access to the baths.\n\nWe both agreed that the massage was a fantastic experience and probably one of the best we ever had. therapists are respectful and very nice.\n\nHowever, the baths experience was not so great. First, it's very noisy. Everyone is talking pretty much in full voice. I don't mind a little conversation here and there, especially if whispered, but this make me feel like I was in the middle of a shopping mall, not a spa.\n\nSecond, the baths are somewhat limited, nothing extraordinary out of this world.\n\nThen it was time to leave as they were closing at 10 pm, which is disappointing, as they should be open later - there were lots of people who did not want to leave, so the demand is there! So considering we got there at 7pm right after work, the time to wait in line to be greeted and given the bathrobes and lockers, the time to take a quick shower and change, it was already 7.45. The massage was scheduled for 8.30, which left us about 25 min in the baths as they request that you be at the massage area 10 min before. one of massage therapists was late. so we were done by 9.45, at which point we were informed that the baths were closed and we should be heading to the lockers.\n\nThe locker space is very tiny! it gets crowded so quickly! people waiting in line to get to their locker, in line for the washroom, in line for the showers... Waaaaay not enough showers to accommodate a spa of their size. So we decided not to wait and left without a shower (which has NEVER happened to me in a spa before). Them, wait in line to pay and leave.\n\nFinally, I have an issue with the bath access fee. It should be free, or at least reduced for those having a massage. Not a good value for money. Walked out of there with $260 bill and really the only positive experience being the massage.\n\nNext time I would rather drive a little more and get to Polar Bear, which IMHO is waaaay better.\n\nif I would ever return there it would be for a massage.And even then, standing in an endless lineup after an awesome massage is not something I am looking for.", "date": "2014-01-17 14:01:04"}

I went with 4 of my coworkers during fall. We had called in earlier to book our massages. Unfortunately it was raining so we couldn't sit outside but we were able to enjoy the thermal baths. When we arrived at the spa, the receptionist gave us our robes but didn't provide us with much information about the spa. We had our massages booked early morning which we headed off first. I had a deep tissue massage which has been probably the best massage I've every had. I had booked it for 90 mins but it was much less than that, because you end up filling out a questionnaire, and answer the masseuse's questions which takes up a lot of the time. The bistro had good food but pricey and very very tight place indoors. It was so hard to walk because the tables were so close. They have flavoured water available through the spa. There wasn't much sauna/steam room options as compared to other spas. Two fairly large thermal baths. You can get other services outdoors where they have huts. When we went to pay at the end, things ended up in a fiasco. We probably spent 45 mins arguing with the receptionist and the assistant manager. Apparently the pricing changed for the spa the same week. When we called to make reservations, the person we all spoke to did not inform us. Their website was not updated either. One my coworkers initially butted heads with the assistant manager because she was overcharging her. When she explained herself the AM was very rude, showed attitude, and did not apologize for the confusion. She ended up paying the full amount which was $60 more than expected. When I arrived to pay, I was warned by my coworker of the situation. The receptionist ended up charging about an extra $120 than what I was supposed to pay. We argued back and forth. I was very clear of how bad they had managed the whole situation. That it was stroms staffs fault for not giving us the new prices when we made the reservations, not updating the website, nor explaining it to us on arrival. Both the receptionist and the AM were quite and had no argument other than these are the prices and you have to pay either a la carte or a package. However the package included services which I did not take advantage of. At the end they gave me a $20 discount which was due to a corporate discount my employer has with the spa. They asked if I was leaving satisfied and I said no, they wanted me to leave happy. I explained to them that this was the worst customer service I had ever dealt with where I came to relax and instead I'm leaving more frustrated and angry. I told them they have forced all of us to pay for something none of us wanted to. The staff showed so much immaturity in how to deal with such situations. Never have I been to a spa where they start a conversation with anger, attitude and roll eyes while trying to sort things out. It might have beautiful water view but not worth the headache.

It's not a club or bar environment where you can chat and \"catch up\". They play soothing music and the sound of the waterfall is really loud and thankfully masks the people chit-chatting.  On the other hand.. they have a group discount for 10 people or more so that kinda contradicts their \"be quiet\" mantra.\n\nI get that it's so close to downtown Montreal and people in Montreal LOVE to socialize but it's really a place for solitude and quietude. Thankfully, the staff is good at letting people know to quiet down. But really, the strong jet sounds and waterfall sounds do mask the talking to some extent but the sounds aren't overpowering or anything either.\n\nYou can request an indoor massage or an outdoor one in the tents. I opted for outdoor :) During my massage, I heard all kinds of birds from the marshland next to the water. One bird (or toad?) sounded like a rubber band, it was so cool.

Are small details important, especially at a spa? YES. After that it was much more straightforward and I took my wristband/keyring down to the change room. \n\nAs change rooms go it was pretty small and sparsely furnished. No razors/cream available, no hair product, and no bathing suit spinner (serious oversight -_-). Still, it was clean with plenty of showers and secure lockers. The entire facility was sparkling clean and free of any funk or funny smells which is pretty important for somewhere you're hanging out in bare feet and a swimsuit.  \n\nTo my dismay, the thermal experience was seriously lacking. They boast 2 hot tubs - one is barely bathwater temperature and the other isn't much warmer. I honestly felt  like I could jump straight in with no discomfort. The jets in both were weak. Both saunas were ok - clean, smelled great (one was 'essential oils' the other 'finnish fir'), and working timers! However they were on the small side. When I was there it wasn't crowded, but any more people and it would have been uncomfortable. In a mixed gender sauna it's nice to have some room to spread out; there wasn't much room to do so.\n\nThe cold plunge pools were a welcome addition on a hot day, but I'm a bit dumbfounded as to why the have two. Both are very small (not that you would want to spend a ton of time in them). One is warmer than the other (still decently cold) while the colder one has a waterfall. \n\nAfter taking a few trips through the cycle, I wanted to check out the cafe/bistro. I walked inside and had a look about the menu. It may have been the fact that it was partly in French, but I found the menu scrawled all over the walls a bit hard to decipher. Nothing was truly appealing but after a few minutes standing at the counter watching employees walk around me, I decided to experiment. I stood there for a few more minutes looking over the menu thinking something might catch my eye. Ultimately I didn't want to spend $15 for a salad or sandwich and not a single employee greeted me or asked if they could help so I walked away. I guess because I don't look like a rich old guy my money is not important.\n\nOverall it's not terrible. Everything was clean and well maintained, but as a destination for the thermal experience only? Pass.", "date": "2012-07-23 19:59:45"}

They gave me an XXXL robe by mistake, but I wasn't mad because it was really flowy and comfy, the downside was that I would drag the waistband.\n\nI got a romantic package for two, Lempia, as a birthday present to my girlfriend which included: 90min couple massage, thermal/water experience, two smoothies and two water bottles. First of all, the staff kept referring to my girlfriend as my \"friend\", which was super weird. Second of all, I've been to Bota-Bota and SkySpa (Dix-30) so I know there are rules in place, but in this place it feels like you are actually being surveilled. In SkySpa, for example, staff would approach you if you were being too loud, which is understandable. But Strom was actually next-level, it was literally all the staff circulating all over the place with an earpiece and talking/observing the whole time, it kind of looked like the president's security team and it was honestly too much. \n\nThe massage was great all-around and the hammocks are lovely and comfy. The water experience, they don't have as many pools as Bota-Bota does, I found myself in a Goldie Locks type of situation, where two pools were too cold and the other two were too hot! I was surprised that there were that few! The smoothies were decent, I didn't try the rest of their food, but it looked good. \n\nAlso, I was weirded out by the fact that they include the water bottles as part of the package, because I saw receptionists giving them to everyone going in. I don't know if they all had packages that included water or if they just put that in the offer to make it sound like they are offering you more stuff?

But that was years ago. \n\nMy first massage was at Strom about 7 years ago and it was an amazing experience. I usually visit around twice per year with friends but on my last few visits, I've been very disappointed - especially during my last experience last week.\n\nFirstly, they keep putting up their prices. Not sure why because they haven't added anything new so already there, I'm not impressed. My last visit cost me over $200, which has never happened to me before and I have been to so many spas! There is no longer a discount if you combine a massage to your bath experience. I think it's obvious that it's a greedy attempt to make more money off of their customers.\n\nTheir robes feel worn and are not as soft probably because this spa has gotten so much more popular over the years that even going on a Friday morning/afternoon is now way too crowded. The amounts of couples that come here to... \"get in the mood\" for a lack of a better way to say it is surprising. Maybe they should build a hotel nearby! I understand shushing groups of people to be quiet but it borders on harassment at times. How come I have to put up with intensely loud make-out sessions from couples stuck to me but I have to be silent 24/7? This is definitely not the kind of spa where I would be comfortable going alone. \n\nTheir massotherapists are always professional and courteous - no complaints there. I especially love getting massages outside in the tents; the natural sounds of the waterfall or the birds chirping really add to the relaxing massage experience as a whole. At their bistro, I ordered the grilled halloumi cheese and fennel salad, as well as the tuna wrap. This healthy and filling lunch set me back around $30. \n\nAll in all, I don't think I'll be going back any time soon unless I have a gift card or a special reason to. It's such a shame because this is the most beautiful spa in Montr\u00e9al.", "date": "2017-07-24 23:51:58"}

DO NOT GO IF YOU ARE GOING WITH FRIENDS TO CATCH UP.  also you have to pay $10 for a bathrobe?  go to http://www.botabota.ca/ it's money better spent.  they don't shush you and they give you bathrobes FOR FREE!!!\n\nif they let people have quiet conversations and gave the bath robes as part of the deal i would like this place a lot better.  it's decent with two nice hot pools one stonehenge-y bubbly pool and one with a hot waterfall!  and two saunas one with aromatherapy.  one one super hot intense steam room with a red light.\n\nit's also very couply in the evening almost like a swingers rave so be warned.\n\ni would go alone but not with a friend again as i go to the spa to relax and catch up with friends \n\nbota bota is much easier to get to too! and really something different after being to spas all over europe and asia.", "date": "2012-11-05 05:01:22"}

I would love to tell you all about how amazing this spa is but unfortunately we have never been able to actually get in. \nAs a subscriber to the newsletter, i see that frequently Strom offers great deal on the thermal experience. Myself and 5 friends all bought one of these deals to celebrate a birthday. However, when you get to the spa to redeem your package deal you are not allowed in. You are immediately wait-listed. The reason - they must reserve the space for people who have booked a service. I pointed out that not everyone who have booked a service are also going to opt for the thermal experience they told me that it doesn't matter. There are not enough lockers. They put you on a waiting list but cannot tell you how long the wait will be. (It ended up being 6 hours the last time we attempted to go). I asked for a refund on the deal we purchased explaining that I paid for a service that they clearly cannot provide me. They said that there are no refunds. What we learnt is that the only way to guarantee entry is to book a service. So you deal that cost $60 actually ends up costing at the very least $90 plus tip and could go up to double depending on the service you book. Additionally, the location is not that convenient and there is nothing around it so even if you get waitlisted there isn't anywhere close by that you can go to to kill time.\nIt really feels like the deals that they send out frequently are a scam. It is just a way to force you to buy a service because they do not have the capacity and do not reserve places for ppl who just want to experience the thermal option. I am very disappointed. Four other couples came in while we were there that had the same issue as myself and my friends and also mentioned that this was the 2nd or 3rd time that they tried to gain entry. Basically I have thrown away $60 or I have to spend an additional $30 to get an overpriced express mani. And honestly, I don't want to give these people anymore of my money.", "date": "2017-11-13 15:09:24"}

With all the steam rising, it was a little foggy to navigate at night.\n\nThe massage was pretty good, if you like gentle relaxing massages (not the kind that actually undo knots - which can be painful)\n\nThe light meal was pretty good...not gourmet, but pretty tasty.\n\nOverall the experience left me feeling very zen.  The only complaint I have is the state of the bathrooms.  There was a lot of hair, and the toilets could have used some cleaning.  Also, someone knocked my robe on the floor at some point, hence it got wet, and they wouldn't exchange it for me, hence I had to walk around in a very cold wet robe.", "date": "2011-12-21 05:23:23"}

Strom is a bit different from what I am used to.  First off, there's no clothing-optional area- big disappointment. Nothing is more relaxing than taking a sauna or steam sans bathing suit. Secondly, they are VERY insistent that it is as quiet as possible in every area imaginable. \n\nOn the plus side, the facility is very nice and extremely clean. The husband and I sprung for a 60min massage, which was excellent. The natural setting is very enjoyable if it isn't too hot out.", "date": "2012-08-07 23:49:53"}

In my case, a good post car accident retreat! There was no time limit to use the baths with my \"Aliz\u00e9\" package so I felt the price was worth it (I stayed from 10h00-17h30).\n\nA negative point:\n\nI arrived on site at 9h50 knowing the baths opened at 10h00 so that I could slowly get ready and try to spend the most time possible at the spa. I tried to open the front door multiple times but after trying so hard I gave up and assumed it was locked. I called the front desk and some people inside were pointing to me but none of the staff stepped away to help. It wasn't until an older women came to the door and failed to open it that the staff came to our aid. \n\nI didn't let this ageist action ruin my day and it didn't! The spa is about letting go so that was my first \"practice\" of the day ;)\n\nGreat therapeutic staff:\n\nI had a massage in the morning and a body scrub/hair treatment in the afternoon. \n\nThe massage therapist was so attentive and I could tell he was paying attention to the stresses in my body. I'd HIGHLY recommend having your massage in the outdoor tent. (His name was Leonard or Laurent; his handwriting was messy)\n\nThe esthetician was also very attentive and personable. (Her name was Jennifer)\n\n*I will triple check their names but I'd recommend them to friends and family*\n\nCalm general vibes:\n\nIt was not crowed on the Sunday that I went. There were two cold and two hot baths. There was a large eucalyptus steam room and two traditional saunas. There was lots of outdoor seating and one indoor reclining chair room.  \n\nOverall/General Comments:\n\nI'd recommend it and go again. It's a lovely spot by the water, surrounded by trees and not far from downtown. I hope to check out the other Str\u00f8m locations in the future! \n\nI've been Scandinave Spa and Bota Bota in the old port but they were smaller than this Str\u00f8m location. \n\nThey weren't so strict about the quiet rule so it's a place where you could chat quietly with a friend but not be too annoyed with people talking all of the time.", "date": "2018-10-15 22:16:27"}

Unfortunately, we arrived a bit later than expected due to the fact that exit to Ile des Soeurs was closed and we had to turn around on the bridge which was extremely busy at that time. \n\nWe arrived about an hour before the 10pm closing time.  We wanted to take advantage of the after 6pm price of $29 as advertised on their website but was told that the prices had just gone up to $34 that week.  Disappointing.  I thought they should have still honoured the $29 price.  Flip flops and bath robes ($10) are available for rental but we brought our own flip flops.  Lockers with a key and 2 towels are provided at no extra cost.  Bring your own bottle water but there is a small dispenser near the change rooms with cucumber and mint infused water.\n\nWe enjoyed the hot tubs and the refreshing cold pools.  Sauna and steam rooms were also nice.  We had to skip the resting areas as we were pressed for time but they looked very relaxing as well.\n\nLoved the modern decor of the spa.  Definitely a nice getaway for couples as well. \n\nDon't expect to be able to talk too loudly with your companions as you wil be shooshed by staff who are trying to maintain the quiet and serene enviroment.\n\nWished we would have had more time to enjoy the spa so would love to come back again in the future.  Drove around a few of the neighbourhoods in the Ile du Soeurs area to gawk at the mansions on our way home.", "date": "2011-05-24 16:24:31"}

We chose Strom after showing at another one and not knowing it was going to be closed.

You can whisper with your friends, and they have more than just one hot tub and all that jazz. \n\nOnly thing is we arrived late at night, it was our first time and no one showed us the premises.

I have to say, that I was concerned about the outdoor thermal pools due to the freezing weather we've been having, but man was I pleasantly mistaken!\n\nUpon arriving, we were warmly greeted and given instructions on where to change, where to go for our massages, and how to use the thermal bath experience. \n\nMy first impression of the facility was that it was very well maintained, super clean, and quite modern (which I'm a huge fan of). The women's change room was superb. I had read several reviews complaining about how small it was, but this couldn't be further from the truth! The rooms are perfectly sized for the facility, and even though it was busy when we were there, the change room was not packed in the least. Again, mirroring the rest of the facility, it was clean, modern, and quite new in appearance. I appreciated the great smelling shampoo/conditioner/body wash, and all the little extras (hair dryer, etc) available. I just wish that there was a swimsuit spinner thing, and a place to leave the towels in the change room instead of having to drag everything back up to the reception.\n\nUpon entering the massage waiting room, we were greeted by our two masseuses, a little dryly. It was nothing close to the regular warm welcome one would expect at a spa, and was quite robotic. So, that got us off to a weird start. Fiance even said that he felt a little off.. (actually, words were \"Now I'm scared\" haha). I wish they were a bit friendlier to set a good atmosphere up for us. Nonetheless, the massages were quite good and relaxing, and the cup of hot tisane at the end was a nice treat. \n\nBy the time we were done, it had started raining, but that didn't stop us from jumping into the 38 degree bath which was phenomenal in the open air. After about 15 minutes, we took a quick (and I mean super quick) dip in the 5 degree pool as is recommended. We then went into one of the dry saunas for a bit, and went to grad lunch at the bistro. The spinach dip with veggies was yummy, and fiance's cubano sandwich and salad were great. We repeated the thermal cycle once more, and then sat underneath some great heaters in our fluffy robes and vegged out. \n\nNeedless to say, it was a great experience, and we were very very very reluctant to leave and face life again.\n\nOnly reason for the 4 stars is the way we were spoken to by our massage therapists. If only they were friendly and capable of smiling, this review would have gotten 5 stars!\n\nWe will definitely return though! Try it out - I don't think you'll be disappointed!", "date": "2012-12-03 01:34:25"}
